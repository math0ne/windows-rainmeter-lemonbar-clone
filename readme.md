&nbsp;

Rainmeter skin style that looks and functions similar to linux bars such as lemonbar, polybar, i3-bar, etc.

This is designed for my surfacebook hi-dpi display, you will have to change the font size and re-size backgrounds if you want to use it on a non-hidpi display.

To get the space on the taskbar to display this I am using T-Clock and just adding a bunch of spaces to the end of my custom clock format text.

# Requirements:
* Disable DIP scaling for spawned windows if you have a Hi-DPI display: https://i.imgur.com/l39QJRE.png
* Nerd Font must be installed: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts
* The files can only be edited in UCS-2 LE BOM Compatible editor such as notepad++
